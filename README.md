# ContactScraper

This is a simple program that I wrote to aid in the making of mailing lists for Engineering House. 

#### Functionality

The Script takes in a csv file with all contact info for the organization, and then iterates through and adds everything to a list. It gen generates smaller lists for On-Floor members and Alumni. 

###### Necessary Fields

The input CSV file must have the following fields

- `First Name`
- `Last Name`
- `Email Address`
- `Phone Number`
- `Years Lived on Engineering House`: Must be in the format of 18-19, or '18-'19, or any combo. ***Cannot*** be 18'-19'
